* This website
This website is generated from [[https://orgmode.org/][Orgmode]] to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML][HTML]] (Manual Web development simply takes way too long).
I still wanted to control everything on my website so I still wrote most of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML][HTML]] all the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS][CSS]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp][Elisp]] manually but only once (like a template).

Best of all it is converted from [[https://orgmode.org/][Orgmode]] my favourite text format.
* Orgroam
My notation system I use is [[https://www.orgroam.com/][Orgroam]], which is based of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten][Zettelkasten methord]].
In basic terms, this is where every note is like a node and then are all connected together.
You can see a representation below:

* DNS Management
This Website Uses [[https://www.cloudflare.com/][Cloudflare]] for DNS management. [[https://www.cloudflare.com/][Cloudflare]] is the leader in the industry when it comes to this and website management.
[[https://www.cloudflare.com/][Cloudflare]] also has many other features that I like using like email aliases. (I know this sounds sponsored but it's really not)
