* How to Hack It

If you're interested in cloning the code to try it out, I recommend [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Binary-Installation.html][installing the GNU Guix package manager]].  Using Guix will allow you to install all compilation dependencies like so:

#+begin_src sh

  cd ~/path/to/Spinter
  guix shell -m manifest.scm

#+end_src

You will now be in a shell with all of the dependencies configured.  You can now build and run the code:

#+begin_src sh

  chmod +x ./start.sh
  ./start.sh  # This is only needed the first time you clone the project
  ./build-run.sh  # This is to build and run the project

#+end_src

** Editor Setup

I use GNU Emacs to hack on and interface with this project. Here's what you need to use for a similar setup:

- Emacs 28 (27 is sufficient)
- [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/][lsp-mode]] with the [[https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls][ccls]] language server for C/C++ development.
