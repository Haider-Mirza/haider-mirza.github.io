* About my Scripts
These are script I have made in bash scripts I use on a day to day basis.
I usually call upon them in my XMonad config which is also on my github ([[https://github.com/Ha1derMirza/Dotfiles][Dotfiles]])
Most of the scripts are used with Dmenu so Make sure you have it installed; Dmenu's documentation can also be found here: [[https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/][Dmenu]]
Here is a link to this repository: [[https://github.com/Ha1derMirza/Scripts][link]]. Pull requests and reporting Issues are appreciated
