* How to send a new Email in orgmode
You start typing your address but when it comes to the actual composing part,
do M-x and type org-mime-edit-mail-in-org-mode to open a new buffer that you can type your org Text in.
C-c C-c to put the text into your email and hides the org buffer then do M-x again and type org-mime-htmlize to convert it to html
and keeps the original if some email clients dont have support for html. And like you know C-c and C-c sends the email.

* How to send a existing org document as a Email
Go to the file and do M-x and type org-mime-org-buffer-htmlize. Press no if it asks to evaluate the buffer.
Then you have a new window showing the email (This is in the normal email buffer not the buffer where you compose email inside Mu4e)
with the org document already in HTML. ( Do the rest of the steps only if you want the email to be composed/sent inside Mu4e )
Then do M-x again and type mu4e-compose-mode to convert it from a normal email buffer to a buffer where you compose inside of Mu4e.

* How to send a subtree as a Email
Go inside the subtree and then do M-x and type org-mime-org-subtree-htmlize and this will take this * only only the top tree AND it's subtrees included in the tree. (Optional (Turning normal email buffer to Mu4e's)) Do M-x again and type in Mu4e-compose-mode to go into the mu4e buffer not emac's inbuilt. And as the name suggests it turns to HTML.
** Note
The Header for the subtree gets put automatically as the title and then the subtree (without the Header) gets put into the main part of the email.
