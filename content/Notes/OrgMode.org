#+description: basically what I write everything in.

* About
A GNU Emacs major mode for keeping notes, authoring documents, computational notebooks, literate programming, maintaining to-do lists, planning projects, and more â€” in a fast and effective plain text system.

You can find Documentation here:
[[https://orgmode.org/][OrgMode]]

* Reminders
Sometimes I forget Functionality in OrgMode.
Even though you can find all the information here: [[https://orgmode.org/][Documentation]]
However I have listed the ones I commonly forget.

** Timestamp with repeater interval
A timestamp may contain a repeater interval, indicating that it applies not only on the given date, but again and again after a certain interval of N days (d), weeks (w), months (m), or years (y). The following shows up in the agenda every Wednesday:

example: [2007-05-16 Wed 12:30 +1w]
*** Note
It is in square brackets so it doesnt trigger in my actual org agenda settings.
