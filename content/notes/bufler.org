** About Bufler
[[https://github.com/alphapapa/bufler.el][Link to Bufler Git repo]]
Bufler is like a butler for your buffers, presenting them to you in an organized way based on your instructions.
The instructions are written as grouping rules in a simple language, allowing you to customize the way buffers are grouped.
The default rules are designed to be generally useful, so you donâ€™t have to write your own.
** Common Issue
I had tried to load "buffer-mode" when I got an error starting with "Recursive Load".
After some research, you can fix this by removing the require on line 70 in *bufler-workspace-tabs.el* everything works.
*Make sure you also balance the parentheses!*
I dont know why but if you get this error, here is a fix.
