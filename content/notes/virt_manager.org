* virt-manager
The virtual machine manager that uses QEMU and KVM.
** How to exit fullscreen
Ctrl-Alt to release cursor.
** Mouse & Keyboard passthrough
Here is a blog post on the matter: [[https://passthroughpo.st/using-evdev-passthrough-seamless-vm-input/][Evdev]]
Here is the commands I used
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo chgrp kvm /dev/input/by-id/usb-MOSART_Semi._2.4G_Keyboard_Mouse-if01-event-mouse
sudo chgrp kvm /dev/input/by-id/usb-MOSART_Semi._2.4G_Keyboard_Mouse-event-kbd
#+END_SRC
** Bugs/Errors
*** Mouse & Keyboard passthrough permission error
You may have it that virt-manager does not have permissions to use a usb device.
Here is an article that shows my exact issue: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/694169/how-to-make-a-usb-device-available-to-a-qemu-guest
Here is the commands I run:

#+begin_src shell
  $ lsusb
   Bus 001 Device 004: ID 17ef:600e Lenovo Optical Mouse

  $ sudo chgrp kvm /dev/bus/usb/001/004
  $ LC_ALL=C ls -l /dev/bus/usb/001/002
#+end_src
