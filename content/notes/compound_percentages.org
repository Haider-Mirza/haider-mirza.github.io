* Compound Percentages
Or, in other words, compound interest.

* Examples

** Example 1
Suppose I have \pound500 in the bank. My bank pays 2% interest a year. How much will I have after:

i) 2 Years
ii) 10 Years
iii) 100 Years

*** Solution
500 \times 1.02 (1 year)
500 \times 1.02 \times 1.02 (2 years)

500 \times 1.02 \times 1.02 $=$ 500 \times 1.02^2 $=$ \pound520.20

And you do the same with the rest of the questions (ii & iii)
*** Note
If we get the same amount of interest each year (2% of 500 = \pound10), this is called *simple* interest.
We would only have \pound600! Almost nobody does this though but there is a change that this may come up in tests.
** Example 2
Bacteria in a petri dish increase in number by 50% every 3 hours.
We had 50 bacteria in a petri dish at midnight on Monday.
How many will there be a week later?
