* Emacs Packages
Emacs is Incredibly extensive, it allows you to configure everything the way you like.
Because of this, there are now many Emacs packages out there and the ones below are some I have documented.

** Some Emacs packages
I just shy of 100 packages (and yet my session is very optimised), these are some I have chosen to document:

[[id:31075352-280e-4ef1-978e-5c189da43657][org-mode]] - The center of all these org* packages. The incredible text format to rule them all!
[[id:8317049b-5a2b-4176-9d39-111f310061c7][org-roam]] - Note taking system (These notes are made with Orgroam)
[[id:048f9912-1412-425b-b331-cfb7af8a8047][org-reveal]] - Creating Web Presentations
[[id:c2647c82-ae0a-4d26-aa62-706a6a8051d4][Bufler]] - Managing buffers
[[id:6a9051c1-b014-4c07-ba52-1dbd9f88220d][Transient]] - A custom UI system (Very useful when programming)
[[id:92cab502-d6ab-47fe-9355-3f5a6c07cf68][Notmuch]] - My Favourite Email Client
[[id:d71d294a-b8e3-48e3-8295-3d373bcd9681][Mu4e]] - Email Client (I don't use this anymore)
