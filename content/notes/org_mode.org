* Org Mode
Org mode, the overpowered feature of Emacs that just makes your brain explode.
You can do almost anything in Orgmode when it comes to documents and more.
** Exporting to seperate formats
You can export orgmode to many other formats with the command, *org-export-dispatch*.
This is pretty incredible but if you want to have many more exporting capabilities you can install a program called pandoc which has to be installed in emacs (ox-pandoc) and on your system (pandoc).
