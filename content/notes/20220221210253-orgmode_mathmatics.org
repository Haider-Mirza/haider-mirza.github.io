#+title: Orgmode Mathmatics

* OrgMode Mathematics
The system is very similar to Latex.
** Mathematical symbols
To use mathematical symbols not on the general keyboard you start with a backslack "\" and then type the symbol you require.
For example: \beta \theta and \neq. These will be automatically converted to symbols on your screen one enabling some minor-mode (I completely forgor â˜  (old random Tiktok joke)).

** Export to HTML
When exporting to HTML, make sure you wrap the equation in "$"
For example:  $(x+5)^2$
** Tables
For now, I have no idea how to place margins on html/css tables cuz they are terrible.
Just add a \\ before the tables to force a line between them
