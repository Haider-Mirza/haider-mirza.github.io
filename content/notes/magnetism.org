* Magnetism
Magnetism is the attraction seen in certain metals (iron, nickel and cobalt). These materials are called ferrous materials.

** Poles
A magnet has two poles: Positive and negative. When two magnets with the same type of pole (e.g Positive and Positive) are brought together, they *Repel*.
Otherwise, they would attract with two different poles (e.g Positive and Negative).
The magnetic forces of a magnet is strongest at the poles.

** Types of magnetism
There are two ways something can give off a magnetic field: One is a *permanent* magnet, where it produces it's own magnetic field.
The other is an *induced* magnet, which becomes magnetic in a magnetic field.
