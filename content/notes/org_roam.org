* About
One of the best ways to think and work through problems is to have a written dialogue with yourself. Using OrgRoam you have a better way to log your thoughts from the day, link them to existing notes, and easily review the notes for any day, all with Org Roam.

* Documentation
You can get documentation from these links:

* NOTE:
To install, make sure you have gcc AND gcc-toolchain installed.
This is only tested on GNU Guix.

* Important information
+ In my configuration my Org roam notes go to the *~/Notes/* directory.

* Inserting node links using completions
You can also use *M-x completion-at-point* to complete the names of nodes inside of double-square brackets *[[]]*.
