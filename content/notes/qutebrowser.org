#+title: Qutebrowser
* Qutebrowser
In my opinion, the best browser in the world which almost none other can rival.
** Common Issues
In Guix, there was a error with the qutebrowser build which makes it so certain fonts wont render.
There is a fix for this. That is to run Qutebrowser with the flags: (the entire command) "qutebrowser --qt-flag disable-seccomp-filter-sandbox"
Here is a link to the problem: [[https://issues.guix.gnu.org/52672][Guix Issue Tracker]]
