* Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes
There are two main "types" of cell structure:

+ Eukaryotic cells which are found in plants, animals and fungi.
+ Prokaryotic cells which are found in Bacteria

** Comparing Cell Types
|                       | Eukaryotic cell                                                                       | Prokaryotic cells                                                                                                    |
|-----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Size                  | Most are about 5\mu{}m - 100\mu{}m                                                            | Most are about 0.2\mu{}m - 2\mu{}m                                                                                           |
| Outer Layers of cell  | Cell membrane - surrounded by cell wall in plants and fungi                           | Cell membrane - surrounded by cell wall                                                                              |
| Cell contents         | Cytoplasm, cell organelles include mitochondria, chloroplasts in plants and ribosomes | Cytoplasm, ribosomes, no mitochondria or chloroplasts                                                                |
| Genetic Material      | DNA in a nucleus - plasmids are found in a few simple eukaryotic organisms            | DNA is a single molecule, found free in the cytoplasm - additional DNA is found on one or more rings called plasmids |
| Type of cell division | Mitosis                                                                               | Binary fission                                                                                                       |
