* Flatpak
I use Flatpak as an alternative package manager to Guix as sometimes the Guix package is flawed or not existant.
** Installation
You can install a Flatpak on servers as Flatpak is decentalized technology.
You should mainly use [[https://flathub.org/home][Flathub]].

You can see the command you have to run to install a Flatpack at the bottom of the webpage.

The command is something resembling this:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ flatpak install flathub com.mojang.Minecraft
#+END_SRC
** Run

Running a Flatpak application is different to a normal application.
You can see the command you have to run if you scroll to the bottom of the webpage.

The command to run a Flatpack application resembles this.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ flatpak run io.gdevs.GDLauncher
#+END_SRC
