* Work
Work is a force causing the displacement of object and is measured In Joules.
/Come on man, Joules is so much better than horsepower. Be greatful!/
** Formula
The formula for work is the following:

$W = F \times d$

Force is mass $\times$ acceleration.
$F = M \times A$

The work(w) done on an object would be equal to the force(f) applied to it multiplied by the distance(d) it travelled.
