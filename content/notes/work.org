* Work
Work is measured In Joules.
/Come on man, Joules is so much better than horsepower. Be greatful/

** Formula
The formula for work is the following:

$W = F \times d$

Force is mass $\times$ acceleration.
$F = M \times A$

The work(w) done on an object would be equal to the force(f) applied to it multiplied by the distance(d) it travelled.
