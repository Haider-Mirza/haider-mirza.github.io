* GLAD
GLAD is extention loader Library to load OpenGL.
** Installation
You actually have to generate the GLAD files using the following website: [[https://glad.dav1d.de/][glad.david.de]].
Yes, there is a [[id:4ce84157-a404-40fa-bdb8-0b3923916969][Guix]] package aswell but at the moment I do not know how to use it.
** Get Working
Make sure you use Both this include and define.
#+BEGIN_SRC c++
  #define GLFW_INCLUDE_NONE
  #include <glad/gl.h>
#+END_SRC
*** NOTE
Be sure to include GLAD before GLFW.
The include file for GLAD includes the required OpenGL headers behind the scenes (like GL/gl.h) so be sure to include GLAD before other header files that require OpenGL (like GLFW).
