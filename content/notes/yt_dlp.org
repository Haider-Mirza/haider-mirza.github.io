* yt-dlp
  yt-dlp is a fork of youtube-dl and personally I was a very early adopter of it as I found youtubedl to be very slow even with major configurations. 
  yt-dlp is now qutite popular and Is even shipped by default by [[id:a228f3b3-4a77-4302-ae26-1276fd852b1d][MPV]].
  
* Common Use cases
  I do mainly use yt-dlp to stream Youtube and Twitch to [[id:a228f3b3-4a77-4302-ae26-1276fd852b1d][mpv]] but I also use it to download videos and playlists in different audio /or video formats.
  
** Audio Downloads
   Here is how you can download a video as a audio file.
   These Probably also work with playlists.
*** opus
    Notice that this will Download this as an opus format which would give you better sound but for compatibily usage use mp3 (which is the next command)
    Obviously, replace this URL with your own
    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
      yt-dlp -f 'ba' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ -o '%(id)s.%(ext)s'
    #+END_SRC
*** mp3
    Here is how you save a video as mp3 if you want very good cross compatibility (otherwise use opus)
    Obviously, replace this URL with your own
    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
yt-dlp -f 'ba' -x --audio-format mp3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ  -o '%(id)s.%(ext)s'
    #+END_SRC
** Video Downloads
   This command will download the best format (video + audio) that is equal to or greater than 720p width.
   Of course, you can change the width to 1080p or anything you like (the actual video has to support it though) 
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     yt-dlp -f "best[height>=720]" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1La4QzGeaaQ -o '%(id)s.%(ext)s'
   #+END_SRC
