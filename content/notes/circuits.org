* Electrical circuits
** Current
Electric current is the rate of flow of electrical charge; this is the flow of charge per second, the bigger the number of electrons the pass through a component, the bigger the current.
*** Calculating current
You can calculate current with the formula
Current is measured in Amps(A) and is represented as 'I'.

$Current in Amps = \frac{charge in Coulombs}{time in seconds}$
or:
$I = \frac{Q}{T}$
** Series Circuits
In fully series circuits, the current at any point in the circuit is the same.
Ampmeters are usually connected in series as a Ampmeter measures current and has a very low resistance.
** Parallel Circuits
Current gets *shared* between branches but voltage stays the *same*.
A Voltmeter should always be connected in Parallel because of it's large resistance.
