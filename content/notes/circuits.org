* Electrical circuits
** Voltage
Voltage is also known as Electric Potential.
Voltage is the amount of energy in [[id:369ef4cf-1d7c-47f1-9d9f-ba21149bc819][Joules (Work)]] avalable to move 1 coulumb of charge (available energy per unit charge).

$Voltage = \frac{work(energy)}{q(charge)}$
** Coulomb
Charles-Augustin de Coulomb said that there was obviously something flowing inside a conductive medium, like a fluid. He called that electric charge.
The unit for electric charge is Coulomb, and it's symbol is "q".

charge = current Ã— time
$Q = I \times t$

This is when:
charge (Q) is measured in coulombs (C)
current (I) is measured in amps (A)
time (t) is measured in seconds (s)

** Current
An electric current is a stream of charged particles, such as electrons or ions, moving through an electrical conductor or space.
*NOTE:* Electrons have a negative charge and flow from negative to postitive. Current is positive to negative.
(When scientists discovered that electron moves from negative to positive instead of positive to negative, they just left current as it is as all calculations will still work)

At it's core, Current is the amount of charge in coulomb passing in one second

*** Calculating current
You can calculate current with the formula
Current is measured in Amps(A) and is represented as 'I'.

$Current = \frac{charge}{time}$
or:
$I = \frac{Q}{T}$
** Resistance
Electron try and pass through the wire but the atom's electric field slow down the Electrons, The faster the electrons go, the more the atoms vibrate creating heat.
This is called resistance. The annoying atoms try and stop the electrons from passing like fighting against a strong gales.

$V = \frac{R}{I}$ (see Ohm's Law below in it's sub-heading)
If we want to pass through more Current with the same resistance, we have to increase the voltage.

Any Component that is made to resist is called a *Resistor*

I guess, the symbol looks like that because the charge will have a hard time going through those wiggly lines, but that is not the point.

** Laws
These circuitry laws are really quite important to remember.
*** Coulomb's Law
I really wont go into this as I do not understand it enough but here is the gist of it:
[[https://www.haider.gq/images/do-not-delete/Notes/coulomb-law.png]]
$F = K_e \frac{q_1 \times q_2}{r^2}$

In other words, Coulomb's law states that the electric force between two static charges is proportional to the product of their charges divided by the square of their distance.
*** Ohm's Law
$R = \frac{Voltage}{Current}$
This is if the temperature is constant.
** AC
Alternating Current is when the Current alternates :)
In other terms AC is where the output of Coulombs is inconsistent in the form of a sinusodial [[id:aa958a15-a946-41f6-aa0c-76e62840ebc1][Wave]] or like a beating drum.

** DC
Direct Current can be explained like the current of the wire being steady with no ripples. Completely stable.
** Series Circuits
In fully series circuits, the current at any point in the circuit is the same.
Ampmeters are usually connected in series as a Ampmeter measures current and has a very low resistance.
** Parallel Circuits
Current gets *shared* between branches but voltage stays the *same*.
A Voltmeter should always be connected in Parallel because of it's large resistance.
** Cool stuff to know
*** Charge of 1 electron
*Very* small charge
$e^- \approx -1.602 \times 10^-19 Coulomb$
