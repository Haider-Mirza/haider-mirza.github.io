* HP creates a Linux laptop
** [2022-05-30 Mon]
HP is soon to release a new laptop called the [[https://hpdevone.com/][HP DEV ONE]].

The laptop runs [[https://pop.system76.com/][PopOS]] which is made by the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux][Linux]] company, [[https://system76.com/][System76]], who also make laptops; making them a direct competitor to [[https://www.hp.com/gb-en/shop/][HP]] (which is also a very small company in comparison).
Despite this, [[https://pop.system76.com/][PopOS]] is a very nice, easy-to-use operating system for users and a great choice for developers which this laptop is intended to be made for.
And from my knowledge, [[https://www.hp.com/gb-en/shop/][HP]] is the company to ship [[https://pop.system76.com/][PopOS]] on a Laptops. [[https://system76.com/][System76]] had [[https://ubuntu.com/][Ubuntu]] on their laptops instead until recently where they added an option for, you guessed it, [[https://pop.system76.com/][PopOS]].
Sadly, as this marketed as for developers, won't help much with Linux's dream of going widespread, but it is another great step in the right direction.

The specs of the laptop is half decent with 16GB of DDR4-3200 memory, 1TB of PCIe NVMe M.2 storage, and an AMD Ryzen 7 Pro processor whith no clear indication of it's generation.
The keyboard will also be designed for Linux, with a Super key rather than a Windows key. The display is a 14inch 1080p display with 1000 nit brightness and from the image we can see dual front facing speakers.
Sadly, this laptop is currently only for sale in the US with a price tag of $1099.

System76 CEO Carl Richell says the HP Dev One is a result of a partnership between his company and HP that’s been “months in the making,” and HP has been trained to provide technical support for Pop!_OS issues.
He also says that while HP has published a website for the HP Dev One, a “real announcement is coming later,” so we should have more information about specs and availability at some point down the road.

But will this replace our legendary Thinkpads? Probably Not.
