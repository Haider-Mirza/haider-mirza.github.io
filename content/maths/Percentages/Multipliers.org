* Multipliers
To do percentage changes quickly we can use multipliers. 
This is a three-step method, but it is very easy once you have practised it: 

1. What percentage of the original amount will we end up with? 
2. What is this as a decimal? 
3. Multiply the original amount by this decimal to get the new amount!
 
* Why use multipliers?
Using multipliers, we can understand the effect of successive percentage (%) changes.
* Common error
\pound100 incremented by 10% then decremented by 10% does *NOT* equal \pound100

** Why?
100 \times 1.1 (110% - increment by 10%) = 110
110 \times 0.9 (90% - decrement by 10%) = 99
\pound99 \ne \pound100 (1% decrease)

You often will find this happen in compound interest.

* Examples
** Example 1 - Tables
These questions are quite simple, All you have to do is use this formula:

For Percentage increase = 1 + ((Percentaage increase)/100)
For Percentage decrease = 1 - ((Percentaage decrease)/100)

It's common sense really, and with this knowledge the following tables can be filled.
\\
| Percentage Increase | Multiplier for percentage increase |
|---------------------+------------------------------------|
|                 10% |                                1.1 |
|                 25% |                               1.25 |
|                 17% |                               1.17 |
|                  1% |                               1.01 |

* Questions
You already know how to find the multipliers and they are quite simple.
So practise with these simple questions:

Find these percentages of amounts using the multiplier method.
1) Increase 300 by 5% = 
2) Decrease 640 by 25% = 
3) Decrease \pound240 by 4% = 
4) Increase \euro1.40 by 7% = 
5) Decrease 975 by 36% = 
6) Increase \pound41 by 7.5% = 
7) Increase \pound60 by 12% = 
8) Decrease 80 by 19% = 
9) Decrease 280mI by 17.5% = 
10) Increase \pound420 by 28%:
