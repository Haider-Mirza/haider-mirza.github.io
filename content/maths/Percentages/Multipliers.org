* Multipliers
To do percentage changes quickly we can use multipliers. 
This is a three-step method, but it is very easy once you have practised it: 

1. What percentage of the original amount will we end up with? 
2. What is this as a decimal? 
3. Multiply the original amount by this decimal to get the new amount!
