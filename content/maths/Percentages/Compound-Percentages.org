* Compound Percentages
Or, in other words, compound interest.

* Examples

Suppose I have \pound500 in the bank. My bank pays 2% interest a year. How much will I have after:
1) 2 Years
2) 10 Years
3) 100 Years

** Solution
500 \times 1.02 (1 year)
500 \times 1.02 \times 1.02 (2 years)

500 \times 1.02 \times 1.02 $=$ 500 \times 1.02^2 $=$ \pound520.20

*** Note
If we get the same amount of interest each year (2% of 500 = \pound10), this is called _simple_ interest.
We would only have \pound600! Almost nobody does this though but there is a change that this may come up in tests.
