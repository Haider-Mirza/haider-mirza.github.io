* Notebook
Randomly, I had thought that I should rewrite maths teacher's notebook digitally (even though it is avalable on Onenote) here, because:
a) To push my orgmode programmed website to a large scale test
b) I'm just a guy who doesnt know how to spend his time wisely

So here I am. My mathmatical digital "Notebook" is in a \beta{}eta stage and wont have all of the topics listed.
Pages contain:
- Two examples
- Common errors people make (if there are)
- Descriptive Explanations
