* Perfect Squares
Sometimes we have to expand brackets where we have a bracket that is effected by an exponent.

You can see an example of this here:
$(x+5)^2$

You will see how to solve these with the examples below.

* Examples
** Example 1

Let's go with this example:
$(x+5)^2$
*** Common Error
Be careful!
A common error is to make a single element of the bracket effected by the exponent
$(x+5)^2 \neq x^2+25$
*** Methord
The exponent (in this case two) effects the entire bracket so what we are really dealing with is this:
$(x+5)(x+5)$

Alot easier now, isnt it?
And as you can see in the Picture above, you just carry along as normal and expand the brackets.
If you dont know how to do so, please see this webpage and see the below image: [[file:Expanding-brackets.org][Expanding Brackets]].

And then we endup with the answer of:

Even though they do not seem like it, both sides of the "$=$" are the same.
** Example 2
Sometimes all we get are some algebraic symbols like in the example below:
$(x+a)^2$

Before you start to panic, think for a second.
Is this really a problem? As you will soon see it's really not.
*** Methord
You just carry on as usual. Everything is represented as algebraic symbols.
I will work this out with you.

So, to reiterate, we have this question: $(x+a)^2$
**** Step 1
As you know from before,
$(x+a)^2$ is the same as $(x+a)(x+a)$

**** Step 2
Start Expanding the brackets.
To do this we do the following: $x \times x , x \times a , a \times x , a \times a$
And then we endup with $x^2 + xa + ax + a^2$

Finally, we collect terms and get $x^2 + 2ax + a^2$
And this is the answer, Well done!
