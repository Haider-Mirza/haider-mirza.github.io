* Examples
** Note:
$4(x+2) = 4x+8$ (*These are both Equal*)

You can see why this works:

** Example 1
$3y(x+4+7^2)$ 

*** Methord
We solve this by going *left to right*.

1. $3y \times x = 3yx$
2. $3y \times 4 = 12y$
3. $3y \times 7^2 = 3y7^2$

You can see this procedure below

And then you collect all of the outputs and then you have expanded your brackets.

$3y(x+4+7^2)$ = $3yx+12y+3y7^2$


Again, you can visualise the brackets here:
