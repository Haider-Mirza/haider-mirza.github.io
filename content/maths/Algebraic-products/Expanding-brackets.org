* Expanding Brackets
To expand a bracket means to multiply each term in the bracket by the expression outside the bracket.
Below are two examples to help you understand this.

* Examples
** Note:
$4(x+2) = 4x+8$ (*These are both Equal*)
You can see why this works:

** Example 1
$3y(x+4+z^2)$ 

*** Methord
We should solve this by going *left to right*. 
This would still work if you complete this in a different order but left to right is reccomended.

- $3y \times x = 3yx$
- $3y \times 4 = 12y$
- $3y \times z^2 = 3y7^2$

Here is a visual representation:

And then you collect all of the outputs and then you have expanded your brackets.

$3y(x+4+7^2)$ = $3yx+12y+3yz^2$


Here is another visual representation:

** Example 2
$(5z+1)(5z+2)$

Again we should solve this by going *left to right*.
This would still work if you complete this in a different order but left to right is reccomended.

Here where we have 2 brackets, the procedure is the same but with both of the elements in the brackets.

*** First Bracket

- $5z \times 5z = 25z^2$
- $5z \times 2 = 10z$

*** Second Bracket

- $1 \times 5z = 5z$
- $1 \times 2 = 2$
