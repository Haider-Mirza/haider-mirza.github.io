* Triple Brackets
Sometimes, instead of having to deal with 2 brackets, we have to deal with *3*.
Here is an example: Expand $(x+2)(x+3)(x+7)$

This is quite daunting at first and you probably have no clue on what to do, but it's actually simple but lengthy.
I will show you how to do so in the following examples.

* Examples
** Example 1
I am going to use the same question as before.

Expand $(x+2)(x+3)(x+7)$

*** Step 1
All you have to do is expand two of the brackets. You can choose any two but generally you do the first two.
There are some occations where you should choose other two brackets to expand to make the question easier but generally we do the first two.

Expanding $(x+2)(x+3)$ will give us:
$x^2+5x+6$

Then we add back the rest of the equation giving us:
$(x^2+5x+6)(x+7)$

You can see the entire procedure here:

It's quite messy but you can makeup what it is trying to say.

This still looks daunting but you should be fine. It is the same as what we did before

*** Step 2
Expand: $(x^2+5x+6)(x+7)$

We do these calculations:
$x^2 \times x = x^3$
$x^2 \times 7 = 7x^2$
$5x \times x = 5x^2$
$5x \times 7 = 35x$
$6 \times x = 6x$
$6 \times 7 = 42$

Then collect like terms: $x^3 + 7x^2 + 5x^2 + 35x + 6x + 42$
$= x^3 + 12x^2 + 41x + 42$

We finally got there! It was a long proccess but well worth it.
** Example 2
Here is an example: $(3x+1)^3$
This is one bracket, but as we see from [[file:Perfect-Squares.org][this webpage]], it's actually: $(3x+1)(3x+1)(3x+1)$
