* My Projects
I am running quite a few at the moment.
Here are some information on them.

** Spinter
[[https://github.com/Haider-Mirza/Spinter][Spinter]] is a test of manipulation of OpenGL and C++ but I have plans to transform this to a game engine.
Nothing is final but this is my current plans.
** My Mathematical Notebook
I have a digital mathematical notebook in construction because maths is the best subjects and deserves better.
Here is a link to it [[https://www.haider.gq/maths/maths.html][Notebook]]
