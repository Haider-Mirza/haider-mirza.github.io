To be completely honest, I didn't think I would ever get to the point where some random person like you would want to visit my website but here we are.
This website was made so I can publicly display information or general Notes.
  
* About me
Hello, my name is Haider Mirza and I am a secondary school student interested in programming and computer science in general.
This website is made for general documentation/notation on my Github repositories, School Projects, Or any of my published projects.
  
* What I am currently doing?
I am currently testing out glfw and opengl using C++
I am also learning how to use programs like CMake in the process.
You can see what I am doing in the Repository: Spinter

* News:
** The UK paid $724,000 for a creepy campaign to convince people that encryption is bad.
   I have read the reasoning behind this entire ordeal and it is clearly flawed in many ways.
   You can tell immediately even from the name that this is a bad idea. I dont even need to continue to explain why.
