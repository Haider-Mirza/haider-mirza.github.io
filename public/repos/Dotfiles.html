This <a href="https://github.com/Ha1derMirza/.dotfiles">repository</a> contains configs that I use on a day-to-day-basis. This was also made possible by GNU Stow otherwise I would have to copy and paste the directories consistently. This Repository has also been lisenced under the GPL lisence V3.
It is called 'dotfiles' because is many linux/gnu &amp; unix operating systems there is a concept of dotfiles.
These files are invisible have a "." at the start of it's name and by default and usually contain configs of installed programs.
Some of these dotfiles are kept in the ~/.config/ directory (which is also invisible due to it having a dot at the start of it's name.)
You can find the link to my dotfiles here: <a href="https://github.com/Ha1derMirza/.dotfiles">Dotfiles</a>
